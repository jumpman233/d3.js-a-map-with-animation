d3.js-a-map-with-animation
--

	To start this project, you need to init a server, WebStorm or tomcat server is 
	recommended(WebStorm is the most best javascript development tool I have ever used).


	I have just learned D3.js for one month(I learn it because of job demand, what I 
	do for my job is totally different), so this project is still simple right now.
	
	Anyway, I think it's inspiring, and I'm going to add some interesting functions 
	to the project.
